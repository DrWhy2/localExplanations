`localModel` is a successor to [`live`](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/live) package. It implements a variant of LIME method for explaining single predictions of black box machine learning models for tabular data.
Interpretable features are created based on [Ceteris Paribus](https://github.com/ModelOriented/ceterisParibus2) plots.
