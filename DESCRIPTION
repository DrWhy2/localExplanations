Description: Local explanations of machine learning models describe, how features contributed
  to a single prediction. This package implements LIME-like explanation method 
  (see Tulio Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939778>) in which interpretable
  inputs are created based on local rather than global behaviour of each original feature.
